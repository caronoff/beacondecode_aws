                       Truncated RLS TAC or National RLS Number
            The 10-bit RLS truncated TAC or National RLS number is the last 3 decimal numbers in the TAC number data field, which allows a range of 1 to 949. The RLS beacon TAC number or National RLS number series are assigned as follows:	
            1000 series is <strong>reserved</strong> for EPIRBs (i.e. 1001 to 1949),
            2000 series is reserved for ELTs (i.e. 2001 to 2949), and
            3000 series is reserved for PLBs (i.e. 3001 to 3949).
            
            These are represented in the RLS messages as bits 41-42 (except when bits 43 to 46 are set to 1111) indicating the beacon type series (EPIRB, ELT, or PLB) and a 10 bit (1-1024) TAC number which is added to the series to encode the full TAC number. (e.g., TAC 1042 would be encoded as 01 for EPIRB in bits 41 to 42 representing 1nnn, where nnn is 042 determined by 0000101010 in bits 43 to 52, and form a binary representation 00 0010 1010 of the decimal number 42.            
            The last numbers 920-949(i.e., National RLS Numbers 920 to 949) are set aside for National Use by Competent Authorities. That is full National RLS Numbers 1920-1949 for EPIRBs, 2920-2949 for ELTs and 3920-3949 for PLBs.
