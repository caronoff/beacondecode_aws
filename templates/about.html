    <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>The International Cospas-Sarsat Programme provides accurate, timely, and reliable distress alert and location data to help search and rescue authorities assist persons in distress.</p>


<h1>Our Objective</h1>


<p>The objective of the Cospas-Sarsat system is to reduce, as far as possible, delays in the provision of distress alerts to SAR services, and the time required to locate a
    distress and provide assistance, which have a direct impact on the probability of survival of the person in distress at sea or on land.</p>

    <h1>Our Strategy</h1>
    <p>To achieve this objective, Cospas-Sarsat Participants implement, maintain, co-ordinate and operate a satellite system capable of detecting distress
        alert transmissions from radiobeacons that comply with Cospas-Sarsat specifications and performance standards, and of determining their position anywhere on the globe.
        The distress alert and location data is provided by Cospas-Sarsat Participants to the responsible SAR services.
Cospas-Sarsat co-operates with the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the
        International Telecommunication Union and other international organisations to ensure the compatibility of the Cospas-Sarsat
        distress alerting services with the needs, the standards and the applicable recommendations of the international community.</p>
